## NNDL library
This is a small library developed while working through Michael Nielsen's [NNDL](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).

In addition to things found in Nielsen's [network2.py](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/src/network2.py), the code contains implementations of:

- Dropout (the inverse variant)
- Classical and nesterov momentum
- L1 regularization
- Data augmentation (very basic)
- Network saving and loading
- Softmax activation and Log likelihood cost
- Per layer control of activation and regularization
